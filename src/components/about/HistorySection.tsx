      <p>
        The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was established in 1966 by His Divine Grace 
        A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The ISKCON Lucknow temple was established in the early 1990s and 
        has since grown to become one of the prominent spiritual centers in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna and Srimati Radharani, known as Sri Sri Radha Krishna. The temple 
        follows the Vaishnava tradition, one of the major Hindu denominations, which worships Vishnu or Krishna 
        as the Supreme Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, ISKCON Lucknow has expanded its services and outreach programs, serving the community through 
        various spiritual and charitable activities. The temple has become not just a place of worship, but also 
        a cultural center that promotes Vedic knowledge, arts, and traditions.
