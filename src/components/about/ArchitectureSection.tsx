      <p>
        The ISKCON Lucknow temple is a beautiful example of traditional Vedic architecture blended with modern 
        construction techniques. The temple's design represents the spiritual cosmos, with its spires reaching 
        toward the heavens and its sanctum representing the center of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temple features intricate carvings, vibrant paintings depicting scenes from Krishna's pastimes, and 
        ornate altars that house the deities. The main prayer hall can accommodate hundreds of devotees, making it 
        suitable for large gatherings during festivals and special events.
